# AROGYA
Arogya is a smart fitness application for the fitness freaks who want to keep track of the calories they intake and follow a strict calorie and nutrient based diet. By using the app, you can access the food scanner, using which you scan the food and can get the calorific value and the nutrition value of the main ingredient of the food item. Along with the food scanner, we also provide the features of pedometer, BMI/BMR calculator and the very new Arogya Baba, the app's own Machine Comprehension Engine, which will portray the role of a Nutritionist. The Comprehension Engine will be able to answer the questions that you ask from the given topics.
This application mainly focuses on the Indian cuisines and has a limited database as of now.
